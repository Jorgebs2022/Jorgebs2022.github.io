Welcome to my first Robotics Mobile Blog!

## Introduction

Mobile robotics is a fascinating and constantly evolving field that combines engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence to develop robotic systems capable of moving and operating in real-world environments. Through the integration of sensors, actuators, and control algorithms, mobile robots can autonomously navigate, make real-time decisions, and perform specific tasks, ranging from exploring unknown terrains to delivering goods.

In this case, I am going to showcase a practice involving a vacuum cleaner without a localization or mapping system, but equipped with a bumper system and a laser. The objective of the practice is for the vacuum cleaner to cover as much space as possible within a room in a time interval set by the examiners, using an algorithm created by me, with the only assistance coming from the data obtained from the bumper and the 180Â° laser.
